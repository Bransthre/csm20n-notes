\section{Preface}
These pieces of notes, to be updated irregularly, are meant to support upcoming syllabus changes in coming semesters of EECS 16A towards Signal Processing.
The contents of these notes will very likely be a superset of any coming semester`s syllabus that involves signal processing, and will therefore have extraneous parts out of some semesters` scopes.
Specifically, these notes will be dedicated to the union of EECS 16A`s past linear algebra content and EECS 20N`s 2011 rendition`s syllabus.

As the volume of this note will naturally exceed a 4-unit course worth of content, it will take a lot of time and effort to complete these notes. Therefore, the project is made open-source for interested parties to help maintaining with.
It will be the primary author's first time reading some of the involved contents in this note, so there may be a lack of upper-division-level insight in signal processing from this note.

The rest of preface will be written when it is finally not Christmas.
