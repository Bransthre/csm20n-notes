\section{Norms of Vectors}

\subsection{Definition of Vector Norms}
In prior courses, we have recognized the following symbol:
\begin{ln-symbol}{Euclidean Norm}{}
    The Euclidiean Norm, otherwise known as a \textbf{2-Norm}, is a mathematical quantity for some vector $\vec{x}$:
    \[
        {\lVert \vec{x} \rVert}_2 = \sqrt{\sum_i x_i^2}
    \]
    which measures the Euclidean distance (Pythagorean Theorem's results) between the starting and terminal point of a vector.
\end{ln-symbol}
While the Euclidean Norm is an extremely common norm, there exist more norms to vectors. \\
Particularly, \textbf{norms} are functions that satisfy the following properties:
\begin{ln-define}{Norm}{}
    A norm is a function $f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \R$ such that:
    \begin{bindenum}
        \item[1.] Non-negativeness: $\forall \vec{x} \in \mathcal{X}, \lVert \vec{x} \rVert \geq 0$, and $\lVert \vec{x} \rVert = 0 \iff \vec{x} = \vec{0}$
        \item[2.] Triangle Inequality: $\forall \vec{x}, \vec{y} \in \mathcal{X}, \lVert \vec{x} + \vec{y} \rVert \leq \lVert \vec{x} \rVert + \lVert \vec{y} \rVert$
        \item[3.] Scalar Multiplication: $\forall \alpha \in \R, \vec{x} \in \mathcal{X}, \lVert \alpha \vec{x} \rVert = \alpha \lVert \vec{x} \rVert$
    \end{bindenum}
\end{ln-define}

It is noteworthy to mention that, almost every norm demonstrates one property of the vector.
For the diversity of characteristics that a vector may have, there certainly exists a diversity of norms for vectors.
For example, a general family of norms that satisfy the above properties would be the \textbf{LP-norms}:
\begin{ln-define}{LP-Norms}{}
    LP-Norms are norm functions defined as:
    \[
        {\lVert \vec{x} \rVert}_p = {\bigg( \sum_{i = 1}^n |x_i|^p \bigg)}^{\frac{1}{p}}
    \]
    for some natural number $p$. \\
\end{ln-define}
Particularly, the Euclidean Norm, otherwise known as the \textit{2-norm} is LP-norm with $p = 2$. \\
Meanwhile, the $1$-norm and $\infty$-norm are defined as follows:
\begin{align*}
    {\lVert \vec{x} \rVert}_1 &= \sum_{i = 1}^n |x_i| \\
    {\lVert \vec{x} \rVert}_\infty &= \max_{i = 1, \dots, n} |x_i|
\end{align*}
where, the $1$-norm of a vector can be stated as the Manhattan distance (Taxicab geometry) of between that vector's starting and terminal point.

\subsection{Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality}
This inequality was active in EECS 16A!
\begin{ln-define}{Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality}{}
    The inequality is phrased as:
    \[
        |\vec{x}^T \vec{y}| \leq {\lVert \vec{x} \rVert}_2 {\lVert \vec{y} \rVert}_2
    \]
    And using the property,
    \[\forall x \in \R, |\cos(x)| \leq 1\]
    \tcblower
    This inequality originates from the following algebraic work:
    \begin{align*}
        |\langle \vec{x}, \vec{y} \rangle| &= |\vec{x}^T \vec{y}| = |\vec{y}^T \vec{x}| \\
        &= |{\lVert \vec{x} \rVert}_2 {\lVert \vec{y} \rVert}_2 \cos(\theta_{\vec{x}, \vec{y}})|
        \leq |{\lVert \vec{x} \rVert}_2 {\lVert \vec{y} \rVert}_2|
    \end{align*}
\end{ln-define}

We observe that the above derivation holds statement on equivalence between inner product and product of magnitudes, cosine. \\
That is justified by the mechanics along which we find the projection of $\vec{y}$ onto $\vec{x}$:
\[
    \proj{\vec{x}}{\vec{y}} = \vec{x} \frac{\vec{x}^T\vec{y}}{{\lVert \vec{x} \rVert}_2^2}
\]
where, since the projection is a multiple of $\vec{x}$ such that $\proj{\vec{x}}{\vec{y}} = t\vec{x}$, we also recognize that,
\[
    \cos(\theta_{\vec{x}, \vec{y}}) = \frac{{\lVert t\vec{x} \rVert}_2}{{\lVert \vec{y} \rVert}_2}
\]
Upon matching the two equations, I acquire:
\begin{align*}
    t = \cos(\theta_{\vec{x}, \vec{y}}) \frac{\pnorm{\vec{y}}{2}}{\pnorm{\vec{x}}{2}} &= \frac{\vec{x}^T\vec{y}}{\pnorm[2]{\vec{x}}{2}} \\
    |{\lVert \vec{x} \rVert}_2 {\lVert \vec{y} \rVert}_2| &= \langle \vec{x}, \vec{y} \rangle
\end{align*}

In fact, we find that the Cauchy-Schwartz is a general case of this inequality:
\begin{ln-define}{Holder's Inequality}{}
    Provided the quantities
    \[\vec{x}, \vec{y} \in \R^n, \text{and some } p, q \geq 1 \text{ s.t. } \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\]
    Then, 
    \[|\vec{x}^T \vec{y}| \leq {\lVert \vec{x} \rVert}_p{\lVert \vec{y} \rVert}_p\]
\end{ln-define}

\subsection{Application of Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality: Norm Ball}
From this concept, let us consider the concept of \textit{``norm ball''}: the geographical object containing all vectors such that their lp-norm is $1$.

\begin{bindenum}
    \item For a $2$-norm, for example, the norm ball looks like a unit circle (containing all 2D vectors with length $1$, hence a circle of radius $1$).
    \item For a $1$-norm, similar logic guides us to a diagonally placed circle (rotated $45^\circ$) centered at the origin with side lengths $2$.
    \item For the $\infty$-norm, has a norm ball of a square centered at origin with side length $2$. This embeds the unit ball from $2$-norm, which embeds the unit ball from $1$-norm.
\end{bindenum}
The last bullet point hints that the area of norm ball is larger for any increase in $p$ such that it embeds the prior norm balls.
\par
Now, let us attempt to solve for some optimization regarding a norm ball:
\[\max_{\pnorm{\vec{x}}{p} \leq 1} \vec{x}^T \vec{y}\]

\underline{\textbf{p = 2}}:
\begin{quote}
    The solution would be, by the Cauchy Schwartz's implication,
    \[\vec{x}^* = \frac{\vec{y}}{\lVert \vec{y} \rVert}_2\]
\end{quote}
\underline{\textbf{p = 1}}:
\begin{quote}
    The expression of dot product is equivalently
    \[x_1 y_1 + \cdots + x_n y_n\]
    Where the constraint is
    \[|x_1| + \cdots + |x_n| \leq 1\]
    For each value the components of $\vec{x}$, which is finite and upper bounded by $1$, we should allocate maximum contribution to the maximum element of $\vec{y}$ to maximize this dot product (a weighted sum of $\vec{y}$'s component, essentially). \\
    Therefore, let $i$ be the index at which $\vec{y}$ has the component of largest absolute value,
    \begin{quote}
        There is an achievable solution for $\vec{x}^*$, being the unit vector $\vec{e}_i$ multiplied by $sgn(y_i)$, so to counter for cases where $\vec{y}$ is negative.
    \end{quote}
    \par
    In turn, we see that
    \[\vec{x}^T \vec{y} = \max_i |y_i| = {\lVert \vec{y} \rVert}_\infty\]
    Meanwhile, let us use the Holder's Inequality to achieve a more rigorous proof. Holder's Inequality states that,
    \[
        |\vec{x}^T \vec{y}| \leq {\lVert \vec{x} \rVert}_1 {\lVert \vec{y} \rVert}_\infty = \max_i |y_i|
    \]
    \begin{quote}
        The Holder's Inequality expresses \textbf{an upper bound}, and the formulation in above section shows \textbf{achievability of upper bound}.
    \end{quote}
    \textbf{\textit{Alternative proof of p = 1 via Triangle Inequality}}: \\
    Via the triangle inequality, we acquire:
    \begin{align*}
        |\vec{x}^T \vec{y}| &= |\sum_i x_i y_i| \\
        &\underset{Triangle\ Inequality}{\leq} \sum_i |x_i y_i| \\
        &= \sum_i |x_i||y_i| \\
        &\leq \sum_i |x_i| \max_i |y_i| = \max_i |y_i| = {\lVert \vec{x} \rVert}_\infty
    \end{align*}
    We see the expression $|\vec{x}^T \vec{y}|$ has an \textbf{achievable upper bound}, assembling all necessary aspects of deriving the solution for the optimization problem.
\end{quote}
\underline{\textbf{p = $\infty$}}:
\begin{quote}
    We can find upper bound of the expressionvia Holder's Inequality,
    \[
        |\vec{x}^T \vec{y}| \leq {\lVert \vec{x} \rVert}_\infty {\lVert \vec{y} \rVert}_1 \leq \sum_i |y_i|
    \]
    The infinity norm of $\vec{x}$ shows the constraint that:
    \[
        \max_i |x_i| = 1
    \]
    and we may simply compute:
    \[
        x_i = sgn(y_i)
    \]
    to find and certify the achievability of this upper bound.
\end{quote}
